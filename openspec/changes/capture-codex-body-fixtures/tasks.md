## 1. Capture lane

- [x] 1.1 Add `scripts/traffic_analysis/codex_body_capture.py`: network-namespace re-exec, in-process origin serving a pinned catalog and the Responses lifecycle, throwaway `CODEX_HOME`, disposable provider token, per-slug/transport/run artifact naming, manifest with SHA-256 attestations, printed summary.
- [x] 1.2 Add the refusals as pure functions raising before any process starts: `assert_output_outside_repo`, `assert_clean_environment` (including the outbound proxy family in both spellings, because the Codex client routes even a loopback POST through `HTTP_PROXY`), `assert_ambient_home_uncredentialed`, `assert_loopback_base_url`, `assert_catalog_path`.
- [x] 1.3 Add behaviour-free public aliases to `origin_fixture` (`decode_request_body`, `response_events`, `sse_frames`, `loopback_host`) instead of duplicating the decode/lifecycle/loopback logic.
- [x] 1.4 Cover the guards and the naming in `tests/unit/test_codex_body_capture_guards.py` (positive and refusing case each). CI never runs `codex` or `unshare`.
- [x] 1.5 Serve both transports the client may choose, keep the turn frame rather than the `generate: false` prewarm, and key every artifact by the transport observed; cover the origin over both transports with a test client in `tests/unit/test_codex_body_capture_origin.py`.
- [x] 1.6 Commit the reference `/models` catalog that produced the corpus as the `--catalog` default, with a catalogs README and a digest pinned against every captured provenance entry.
- [x] 1.7 Make the isolation attestation an observation: carry "already inside the namespace" on the child's command line instead of in an inheritable environment variable, read the namespace's interfaces from the kernel before capturing, refuse when anything but loopback answers, and record the observed list in the manifest as `network_isolation`.

## 2. Sanitiser and privacy gate

- [x] 2.1 Add `scripts/traffic_analysis/codex_body_sanitize.py`: positive top-level allowlist that fails closed, telemetry drops, identifier placeholders, input-item text rewrites, absence preservation, idempotence, headers sidecar.
- [x] 2.2 Scope the text rewrite to an item's text-bearing fields — `content`, and equally a tool call's `arguments` and a tool result's `output` in both forms — so the Lite `additional_tools` bundle in the item's `tools` array stays byte-identical (Codex's `spawn_agent` description documents `/root/<task>` agent namespaces that a catch-all path rewriter destroys), and back it with a value-conditioned gate pattern for an environment tag or skill inventory left unreplaced at any depth.
- [x] 2.3 Add `scripts/traffic_analysis/fixture_privacy_scan.py`: reuse `privacy_scan.scan_tree` for credential shapes; add the identifier pass with value-conditioned patterns so Codex's legitimate numeric `session_id` tool parameter never matches; read the bare-telemetry-key exemptions from `provenance.json` so the documented strict command passes on a pristine checkout with no flags.
- [x] 2.5 Keep the identity pass machine-independent: pin it in the committed gate, and skip host/account names that name no operator (container and CI defaults, Codex payload vocabulary) so the gate cannot report an unclearable finding and the sanitiser cannot rewrite `/root` out of real content.
- [x] 2.4 Cover removal (against output bytes), preservation (byte equality and absence), idempotence and fail-closed in `tests/unit/test_codex_body_sanitizer.py`.

## 3. Corpus, provenance and the gate

- [x] 3.1 Capture `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.6-sol` bodies with Codex 0.154.0 through the new command; sanitise and commit them.
- [x] 3.2 Add `tests/fixtures/codex_bodies/provenance.json` as the machine-readable source of truth, including the expected view and the expected portability verdict per fixture.
- [x] 3.3 Add `tests/fixtures/codex_bodies/README.md`: corpus table, recorded verdicts, the divergence table against Codex 0.154.0, the runbook, the pre-commit checklist, the limitations.
- [x] 3.4 Add `tests/unit/test_codex_body_fixtures.py`: shape through production's `openai_compat` dispatch, recorded-verdict assertion, production cross-pins, files ↔ provenance ↔ README sync, privacy gate.
- [x] 3.5 Plant the mutations (re-added telemetry, live cache key, operator home path, credential shape, removed tool surface, flipped origin, wrong recorded reason, undeclared file) on `tmp_path` copies and assert the shipped gate rejects each.
- [x] 3.6 Correct the synthetic pair where it was unemittable (`reasoning_summary_delivery`, `parallel_tool_calls`) and placeholder its identifiers; keep it pre-strip.
- [x] 3.7 Correct the stale `tests/unit/test_model_sources_projection.py` docstring (WP-C2 shipped in #2257; the corpus now gates the production flip).

## 4. Specs and docs

- [x] 4.1 `compatibility-tooling` delta: carve the committed-fixture exception out of the version-control prohibition; add the isolated capture lane requirement with its refusals.
- [x] 4.2 `model-source-routing` delta: the corpus must record provenance and the gate must assert the recorded verdict.
- [x] 4.3 `docs/traffic-parity.md` section, cross-linked with the fixture README, with every command in the `uv run python -m` form the rest of the document already uses (a bare `python` is neither present nor sufficient on a typical host).
- [x] 4.4 `openspec validate capture-codex-body-fixtures --strict`, ruff, ty, targeted suites.

## 5. Follow-ups (not this change)

- [ ] 5.1 Owner decision: close the three portability gaps the captures expose (tolerate `tool_search.execution`, accept the real `web_search` declaration fields, strip input-item ids before the overflow decision) or accept that native Codex traffic never overflows. Separate issue and PR.
- [ ] 5.2 Correct `add-subscription-overflow-model-source/design.md` decision 21, whose `{type, description?}` declaration shape is a premise these captures falsify.
- [ ] 5.3 Owner decision: whether a credentialed ChatGPT-auth capture is worth one real upstream request and quota. Recommendation is no for v1; the limitation is recorded in the corpus README.
