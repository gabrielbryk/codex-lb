## Context

Closes design v3 §16 item (i) of `add-subscription-overflow-model-source` ("captured bodies replace the synthetic pair"), which was written as a WP-C2 verification item. WP-C2+D shipped in #2257 and `api.py` already calls `resolve_subscription_overflow`, so the corpus no longer gates C2 — it gates the **production flip / canary**, which is why the recorded verdicts matter more now than they would have then.

## Decisions

1. **Capture in the origin, not behind a proxy.** C2-PREFLIGHT §4 proposed running `origin_fixture.py` as a reverse origin behind the mitmproxy addon with `capture_body_mode=full`. That is not possible as written: `capture_body_mode` is an option of `scripts/traffic_analysis/mitmproxy_addon.py` rather than of `origin_fixture`, mitmproxy is not installed and its documented invocation goes through a package manager this host cannot run, and `origin_fixture._read_request_json` parses the body and discards the bytes. The origin receives plaintext HTTP on loopback, so it can persist the decoded bytes itself — no TLS, no addon, no zstd guesswork (`decode_request_body` already handles the `Feature::EnableRequestCompression` encoding).

2. **Kernel-enforced isolation over reviewed isolation, and observed rather than asserted.** `unshare --map-root-user --net` plus `ip link set lo up` works unprivileged and makes external egress impossible rather than merely unconfigured. Files created inside map back to the invoking account outside. `--no-network-namespace` exists for hosts without `unshare` and demands an explicit second flag, so the safe path is never the accidental one. The claim is then *measured*: the run asks the kernel for its namespace's interfaces (`socket.if_nameindex`, which is namespace-aware — `/sys/class/net` is not, because `unshare --net` creates no mount namespace and sysfs stays bound to the one it was mounted in) and refuses unless loopback is the only answer. The child learns it is already inside on its command line, not through an environment variable: an inherited `CODEX_BODY_CAPTURE_NETNS=1` skipped the re-exec entirely while the run still printed "loopback only" and recorded `network_namespace: true`, which is the failure mode an attestation derived from flags cannot detect.

3. **A pinned catalog is mandatory, not an optimisation.** The Codex model manager caches `/models` for 300 s and invalidates on a `client_version` mismatch, so a capture with a newer CLI than the cache always refetches from the provider's base URL. The catalog file is therefore part of the run and its digest part of the provenance. It is *not* sufficient provenance: 0.154.0 layers bundled `model_info` overrides on top of the served rows — a row with `apply_patch_tool_type: null` and `supports_search_tool: false` still yields a body containing a custom `apply_patch`, `web_search` and `tool_search` — so the CLI version is primary and the digest secondary. A throwaway `CODEX_HOME` also protects the operator's own cache, which an earlier origin-fixture run had already polluted with a probe row because cache eligibility ignores provider identity.

4. **Provenance lives in a sidecar, never in the body.** `overflow_portability_view` declines unknown top-level fields with `not_portable_unknown_field`, so an in-body origin marker would both change the verdict and break the byte-fidelity claim.

5. **Record the real verdict instead of forcing green or red.** A real capture makes the synthetic pair's "portable once `custom` is declared" assertion false, and `transcript_is_source_free` false. The gate therefore asserts the verdict `provenance.json` records. CI states the fact that native Codex traffic cannot overflow; it neither hides it nor fails on it.

6. **Two fixture roles in one directory.** The synthetic pair is *pre-strip*: it carries `client_metadata` and `stream_options` on purpose, because the projection unit tests exist to prove `strip_source_telemetry` removes them. The captured pair is *sanitised*. `carries_client_telemetry` in provenance distinguishes them, and it is the only exemption the privacy gate grants — a bare telemetry key name. Every value-shaped finding (live UUID, workspace path, email, host identity, credential shape) applies to both roles.

7. **Validate through production's own dispatch.** A real Responses-Lite body has no `instructions` key (`ResponsesApiRequest.instructions` is skipped when empty and the Lite branch hardcodes an empty string), so `ResponsesRequest.model_validate` fails with `instructions Field required`. Production survives because `api._has_openai_responses_shape` returns true for `input`-without-`instructions` and the request validates as `openai_compat`. Any fixture-shape test must use `normalize_responses_request_payload(payload, openai_compat=_has_openai_responses_shape(payload))`, or it red-lines for the wrong reason the day a capture lands. The synthetic Lite fixture hid this by writing `"instructions": ""`.

8. **The sanitiser's text walk is scoped to message content.** A whole-subtree string rewrite corrupted Codex's own `spawn_agent` description, which documents agent task namespaces as `/root/task1`. `/root` is consequently not treated as an operator path at all: it identifies nobody (it is the same string on every root-run machine) while flagging it would force mangling genuine model-facing content. The Lite `additional_tools` bundle is byte-preserved for the same reason `tools` is — it is Codex-generated and it is the evidence for `not_portable_lite_namespace`.

9. **Input-item ids are replaced, not deleted, by default.** A non-empty prefixed id is precisely what makes `responses_input_items_are_self_contained_fresh_replay` return false, so deleting it would erase the evidence for the third portability gap. `strip_item_ids=True` produces the stripped variant when a future fixture needs one.

## What the captures establish

Against the captured Codex 0.154.0 `gpt-5.5` body, run through `ResponsesRequest.model_dump_for_forwarding()` → `strip_source_telemetry(strip_service_tier=True)` → `overflow_portability_view` → `responses_payload_is_provider_portable`:

| declared `supported_tool_types` | verdict |
|---|---|
| `{}` | `not_portable_tools` / `custom` |
| `{custom}` | `not_portable_tools` / `tool_search` |
| `{custom, web_search}` | `not_portable_tools` / `tool_search` |
| `{custom, tool_search, web_search}` | `not_portable_tools` / `tool_search` |

Three independent causes, each pinned to source:

1. The real declaration is `{"type": "tool_search", "execution": "client", "description": "…"}`, and `replay_safety._STATELESS_TOOL_DECLARATION_FIELDS` admits exactly `{description, type}`. Declaring the type cannot help. Decision 21 of the overflow design states that shape as a premise; the premise is false against 0.154.0.
2. The real `web_search` declaration carries `external_web_access` and `search_content_types`, outside `_ACCOUNT_NEUTRAL_TOOL_DECLARATION_FIELDS["web_search"]`.
3. Every input item carries a prefixed `id`, and `responses_input_items_are_self_contained_fresh_replay` rejects any non-empty item id, so the body is `not_portable_history` once the tool reasons are cleared. The overflow decision runs before `strip_input_item_ids`, which is release-direction only.

Removing all three by hand from the captured body yields a portable verdict with `transcript_is_source_free` true, which is how the causes were isolated.

The Lite capture confirms `Declined("not_portable_lite_namespace", "reasoning.context")` — the one verdict the synthetic pair already got right — and adds that the real bundle declares the `functions` and `collaboration` namespaces with no `web` or `image_gen` in this lane, behind four developer prefix messages rather than one.

## Limitations recorded rather than fixed

- The lane is uncredentialed. A ChatGPT-authenticated capture would add account headers, possibly `service_tier` and `access_programs`, the real upstream catalog and the operator's real skills — none of which the body-level gate reads, at the cost of a real upstream request and quota.
- The host/account identifier pass only recognises the machine running the sanitiser and the scanner.
- The identifier pass covers JSON bodies; prose and `provenance.json` are human-reviewed, while credential shapes are rejected in every file.
