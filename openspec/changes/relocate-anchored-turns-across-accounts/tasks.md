- [x] Resolve the fence-retirement collision. #2366 merged and was reverted by
  #2383, so `claim_unknown_operation_for_recovery` and the
  `expected_recovery_dispatch_count` CAS predicates are back on `main`. Keep the
  dependency recorded so the retirement is not reattempted.
- [ ] Gate every relocation lane on the transport actually having the material
  it needs. `record_operation` has exactly one caller
  (`_service/http_bridge/request_submit.py`), so only bridge turns have a
  durable chain, and the side-effect dedupe is wired only there too. A transport
  without durable material must report an absent transcript and keep today's
  behaviour; a transport without the dedupe contract must not take the fenced
  lane. Add the negative tests for both.
- [ ] New pure module `app/modules/proxy/replay_relocation.py`:
  `RelocationInputs` / `RelocationVerdict` / `decide_relocation`. Decline order:
  downstream-visible output, then ownership facts (`single_account`, file pin,
  turn-state owner, session identity), then evidence, then the source ladder
  (client full resend -> durable transcript -> unanchored), each ending in
  `responses_payload_is_account_neutral_fresh_replay`. Closed vocabulary for
  `decline_reason`. No lenient fallback projection.
- [ ] `app/modules/proxy/replay_safety.py`: add the pure transcript rebuild —
  parent-chain assembly oldest first (the order the repository returns), prefix-overlap dedupe against the client
  suffix — compare items AFTER the account-neutral projection, not before, or
  the spool's item ids and reasoning items make identical turns compare unequal
  and the conversation is doubled — terminal-output extraction from the spooled SSE with the
  `response.output_item.done` fallback when `response.incomplete` omits
  `response.output`. Keep the module free of persistence imports by accepting
  transcript turns structurally. Use one overlap routine, not two.
- [ ] `_service/support.py`: `materialize_relocation(...)` — the only caller of
  `DurableBridgeRepository.get_replayable_transcript`; load failure is treated
  as "no transcript"; emits one structured `relocation_decision` log line.
  Add `_durable_bridge` to `_StreamingServiceProtocol`.
- [ ] Delegate the five existing bespoke implementations to the shared verdict:
  `_service/streaming/retry.py` (`_verified_cross_transport_fresh_replay`,
  `_stream_owner_bound_to`, `_move_verified_fresh_replay_from_owner` and its
  four call sites), `_service/http_bridge/streaming.py`
  (`_VerifiedDurableFullResend._verify`, `classify_durable_full_resend` and the
  replay sites), `_service/websocket/helpers.py`. Leave `_service/compact.py`
  on today's behaviour — it is a separate change.
- [ ] Fenced lane (case ②): claim through
  `claim_unknown_operation_for_recovery` with a bound of one dispatch per
  operation; require zero spooled events, no response id, and an elapsed
  dispatch age within the ambiguity window; arm the side-effect replay-dedupe
  identity on the relocated dispatch; restore the claim via
  `mark_operation_unknown(restore_recovery_dispatch_claim=True)` on
  post-claim/pre-frame failure and `rollback_operation_before_dispatch` when
  nothing was written; on a refused claim terminate through the transport's own
  existing fail-closed outcome (the bridge's `upstream_operation_status_unknown`
  503 with its cooldown hint) without a second dispatch.
- [ ] Unfenced lane (case ①): definitive evidence rolls back rather than claims;
  assert in tests that it never decrements the recovery budget.
- [ ] Constants, not settings: the relocation transcript caps, the ambiguity
  window and the one-shot bound are module constants. Confirm
  `[settings_fields].max` stays 96.
- [ ] New `tests/unit/test_replay_relocation.py`: the decision table —
  transports x sources x evidence x ownership facts, asserting `movable`,
  `source` and the exact `decline_reason` for every cell.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_replay_safety.py`: parent-chain rebuild; overlap dedupe
  including the single-item overlap and the tail-match form; `response.incomplete`
  without `response.output` falling back to accumulated
  `response.output_item.done`; no terminal marker -> `None`; broken or cyclic
  chain -> `None`; scalar input -> `None`; unsettled tool call -> `None`;
  non-portable tool -> `None`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_proxy_http_bridge.py`: ① anchored delta continuation with
  an exhausted owner relocates and dispatches exactly once; ② eventless
  ambiguous failure relocates exactly once and the second attempt terminates
  with `upstream_operation_status_unknown`; ② with a spooled event declines
  **without** consuming the claim; ② past the ambiguity window declines;
  restore the concurrent-reconnect single-claim test the #2336 archive deleted;
  preflight failure after the claim refunds the budget.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_bridge_ring_lifecycle.py`: the one-shot bound; refund
  semantics; spool reset clears `event_spool_complete` and `event_bytes`;
  `get_replayable_transcript` returns `None` after a reset.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_proxy_errors.py`: restore the classification cases the
  #2336 archive removed, in the new shape.
- [ ] Fix the chain-order statement everywhere it is repeated: the repository
  returns turns oldest first (`turns.reverse()` before return), and any test
  name or comment saying "oldest last" is wrong even where the code is right.
- [ ] `openspec validate --specs`, `uv run ruff check`,
  `codex review --base origin/main`.
